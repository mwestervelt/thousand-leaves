    'content1': `REFORESTATION WITH BRAZILIAN TROPICAL TREE SPECIES IN THE ATLANTIC FOREST:`,

    'content2': `Re-introducing a forest into a deforested area is simpler than you may think, just copy the teachings of nature using the Secondary Succession System and thoroughly manage the entire process with care and dedication. The 3,300 ha (33,000,000 m2) Tijuca National Park, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil considered the largest urban forest in the world, was fully reforested in the 19th century with a workforce of just over 30 people. Since the Tijuca Forest in 1870, several reforestation projects have been extremely successful. Millions and millions of trees have already been planted, covering several acres, interconnected by vegetation corridors, re-introducing forests and ecosystems. At the same time, the Atlantic Forest has a very fast regenerating power, with countless pollinators such as birds, insects and mammals. It just needs a push start.`,

    'content3': `THE SECONDARY SUCESSION SYSTEM:`,

    'content4': `The Secondary Succession System is a technique that was developed to facilitate the process of planting a forest using several different species from different tree families. This system is nothing more than a way of copying how nature itself acts in the natural restoration of a forest, in which the Primary species settle in first, followed by the Late ones, which often grow in the shadows of the Primary, making it possible for the Climax to establish at the very end of this cycle. There are no precise divisions between the classifications. Primary and Early Secondary overlap, depending on soil and climate conditions, and many species may vary by category.`,

    'content5': `PRIMARY:`,

    'content6': `In a tropical forest, when the tree cover is entirely removed, the soil loses its nutrients rather quickly do to rainfall, and intense sunlight; The forest looses its ability to regenerate spontaneously. There are tree species referred to as Primary that naturally settle in these areas of depleted soil, devoid of nutrients from the lack of a natural canopy cover that provides substrate from its fallen leaves, and from intense sunlight. The Primary species are characterized by fast growing, softwood, early fruiting, and a relatively short life. They are also known as Shaders because they help prepare the field for the late species to grow in their shade. Shaders also help to eliminate the tall grass that needs a lot of sun to flower and to fruit. For a fast shading condition, it is very important that the saplings are planted very close to each other with spacing of only 1.5m to 2.5m (5' to 6.5'). Of all species, those in the Leguminosae family are most important, because they have the ability to fix Nitrogen in the soil through their root system, thus improving soil conditions for all other species from different families planted in the same area. Therefore it is important to give ample preference to Leguminosae, especially in the beginning of planting when the soil is still very poor. Leguminosae are: Leguminosae Papilionoideae (Leg. Pap.), Leguminosae Mimosoideae (Leg. Mim.), And Leguminosae Caesalpinoideae (Leg. Caes.)`,
    'content7': `EARLY SECONDARY AND LATE SECONDARY:`,

    'content8': `Secondary trees are slower-growing trees with generally harder wood, although some can grow quite fast depending on the weather and soil conditions. In theory, the Secondary species grow in the shadow of the Primary, eventually surpassing the Primary in height. The Secondary are divided into two categories, Early Secondary and Late Secondary, and are the species that draw attention in the landscape with magnificent blooms, such as the IpÃª, Jacaranda, Sapucaia, Quaresmeira  Aangico, Paineira, including most of the palm trees, and this group gracefully embellish our tropical forests, helping feed the fauna, as well as providing some of the trees that produce excellent quality wood, as it is also the case with the six species cited above.`,
